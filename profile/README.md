- We offer tailored training to deepen cloud-native knowledge and to prepare experts for successful certification as Kubernetes Administrators (CKA), Application Developers (CKAD), and Kubernetes Security Specialists (CKS).

In 2021, we became a member of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) & The Linux Foundation (LF), re-certified as a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP), certified as FinOps Service Provider, certified as Kubernetes Training Partner (KTP), became a member of FinOps Foundation ... and if that's not enough as of November 2021, we are one of the top 100 contributors to Kubernetes.
